    "I would prioritize adding the new user source. Because of two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Mathematically, adding the new user source makes more money than 10-day sale action. ($119.451 > $119.251)\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Heuristically, while 10-day sale would create a short-term hype and money, it would be temporary. On the other side, adding permanent new user source would go continious and in the long term, we might be able to statistically test or analyze the effect of this action because we would have enough data in the long term for this action.
