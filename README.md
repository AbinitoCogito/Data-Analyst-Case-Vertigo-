# A/B Testing - Simulation and Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository consists of an A/B test on difficulty flow analysis and exploratory data analysis on a game dataset. 

## Objective
Evaluate which variant performs better in terms of:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Total Revenue (Ads + IAP)

## Methodology
- Daily installs: 20,000 per variant
- Cohort stacking approach
- Log-linear interpolation for retention curves

## Structure
- notebooks/: step-by-step analysis
- src/: reusable simulation and analytics functions
- assets/: figures used in README

## Status
Work in progress.
